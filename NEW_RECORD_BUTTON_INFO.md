# 📝 New Record Button - Updated

## ✅ What Changed

The **"Reset Counters"** button has been replaced with a **"New Record"** button that provides a complete fresh start!

### **Old Behavior:**
- ❌ Button: "🔄 Reset Counters"
- ❌ Only cleared male/female counters
- ❌ Rounds remained (confusing!)

### **New Behavior:**
- ✅ Button: "📝 New Record"
- ✅ Clears male/female counters
- ✅ Clears all rounds
- ✅ Complete fresh start for next service

---

## 🎯 Why This Change?

The old "Reset Counters" button was confusing because:
- It only reset the current counters
- Round totals remained
- Users had to separately clear rounds
- Not clear when to use it

The new "New Record" button is better because:
- **Clear purpose** - Starting a new service record
- **Complete reset** - Everything cleared at once
- **One action** - No need to clear rounds separately
- **Better workflow** - Matches how you actually use the app

### **Scenario 2: Using Rounds**

## 🔔 What Happens When You Click "New Record"

### **Confirmation Dialog:**
```
Start a new record? 
This will clear all counters and rounds.
```

## 📊 Round Management

You still have separate control over rounds:

- Clears only the rounds
- Keeps current counters
- Use when you want to restart round counting

### **"📝 New Record" Button:**

- Use when starting a new service
