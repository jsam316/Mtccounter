## ✨ Tips & Best Practices

### **Tip 1: Use for Large Services**
If counting 200+ people, break into sections:
- More accurate
- Less overwhelming
- Easy to verify

### **Tip 2: Label Your Rounds Mentally**
Keep track of what each round represents:
- Round 1 = Left side
- Round 2 = Right side
- Round 3 = Balcony

### **Tip 3: Verify Counts**
Count twice and compare:
- First count = Round 1
- Verification = Round 2
- Should be similar

### **Tip 4: Clear Between Services**
After saving record:
- Click "Clear Rounds"
- Start fresh for next service

### **Tip 5: Don't Mix Purposes**
Either use rounds for:
- Multiple sections of ONE service, OR
- Multiple separate services
- Don't mix both
